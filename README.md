The online portfolio is a small project to keep my online presence.

The project uses
1. Backbone : For generating html markup from raw json data
2. Bootstrap : For responsive design and layouts
3. JQuery : As always, for dom manipulation
4. Underscore : For rendering html templates via backbone views

The code is not compressed/uglified. Most of it is commented. 
This project is a small learning place where I can implement new things.
